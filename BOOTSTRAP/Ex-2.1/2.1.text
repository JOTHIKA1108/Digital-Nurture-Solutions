When you download the Bootstrap package (like bootstrap-x.x.x-dist.zip), inside you typically get these main folders:

1. css/
Contains all the CSS stylesheets for Bootstrap.

Main files inside:

bootstrap.css — The full, unminified CSS file (easy to read, good for debugging).

bootstrap.min.css — Minified CSS (compressed for faster loading).

bootstrap.rtl.css and bootstrap.rtl.min.css — Right-to-left language support versions.

Purpose:
This folder holds all styling rules that make Bootstrap components look and behave properly visually.

2. js/
Contains JavaScript files that add interactivity and dynamic behavior to Bootstrap components.

Main files inside:

bootstrap.bundle.js — Includes all Bootstrap JS plugins and Popper.js (needed for dropdowns, tooltips).

bootstrap.bundle.min.js — Minified version of the bundle.

bootstrap.js — Only Bootstrap JS plugins, without Popper.js.

bootstrap.min.js — Minified version without Popper.js.

Purpose:
JavaScript files power interactive elements like modals, carousels, dropdowns, accordions, tooltips, popovers, etc.

3. icons/ (If downloaded separately or when using Bootstrap Icons)
Contains SVG icon files, CSS, and fonts for Bootstrap Icons.

This folder may include:

bootstrap-icons.css — The CSS file to use icons in your HTML.

fonts/ — Font files (like .woff2, .ttf) that support icon rendering.

icons/ — Individual SVG files for each icon.

Purpose:
This folder provides a library of vector icons that integrate seamlessly with Bootstrap styling, used for buttons, navigation, alerts, and many UI elements.
